# STAT401

The only purpose of this repo is to reduce the uncessary manual computational time for the course STAT401 at University of Maryland, College Park. STAT401 covers 6 chapters of the book "Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences" 9th Edition by Jay L: Chapter 7 (Statistical Intervals Based on a Single Sample), Chapter 8 (Tests of Hypotheses Based on a Single Sample), Chapter 9 (Inferences Based on Two Samples), Chapter 10 (The Analysis of Variance),Chapter 11 (Multifactor Analysis of Variance) ,Chapter 12 (Sample Linear Regression and Correlation), and Chapter 14 (Goodness-of-Fit Tests and Categorical Data Anlysis).

I didn't include any code for chapter 11, but I recommand several pretty useful ANOVA websites. [Here](https://statpages.info/anova1sm.html) and [here](https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/anova/default2.aspx)

I also include my notes. Wish you find them useful for your course
